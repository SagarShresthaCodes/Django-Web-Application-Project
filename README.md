# Django-Web-Application-Project
This repository consists of all files and proper codes required to create an application (dogs_project) that displays information for all dogs in the database, using Python's Django web framework. The site/application also allows owners to add information for any additional dogs they own by filling out a form created using ModelForm.

- Used the JS Fetch API to POST user credentials and fetch responses from the server. Upon user authentication, user info is stored in the sessionStorage, which is referenced to display a personalized welcome message.
- Used leaflet JS library to display a map showing the location of the restaurant and set the zoom level for a good user experience.
