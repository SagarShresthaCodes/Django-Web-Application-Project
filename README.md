# Django-Web-Application-Project
This repository consists of all files and proper codes required to create a web app (dogs_project) that displays information for all dogs in the database, using Python's Django web framework. The website for the application also allows owners to add information for any additional dogs they own by filling out a form created using ModelForm.
